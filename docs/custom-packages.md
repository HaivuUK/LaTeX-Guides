# Custom Packages

TeX makes it easy to create custom packages. Custom packages can be anything from a simple collection of commands,
document templates/themes, or even a full-fledged package that provides a new functionality.

## Creating a Custom Package

To create a custom package, you need to create a `.sty` file. The `.sty` file is a LaTeX package file that contains
commands and environments that you want to use in your document.

Here is an example of a simple custom package that defines a new command `\hello`:

```latex
% hello.sty
\ProvidesPackage{hello}
\newcommand{\hello}{Hello, World!}
```

To use the custom package in your document, you need to load it using the `\usepackage` command:

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{hello}

\begin{document}

\hello

\end{document}
```

## Installing a Custom Package

!!! Note
    If you plan to use the custom package in multiple documents, it is recommended to install the package in your TeX
    `texmf` directory.

To install a custom package, you can place the `.sty` file in the same directory as your document, or you can install
it in your TeX distribution so that it is available to all your documents.

For custom packages it is generally recommended to install them in your user `texmf` directory. This directory is
usually located at `~/texmf/tex/latex/` on Unix-like systems and `C:\Users\<username>\texmf\tex\latex\` on Windows.

After placing the `.sty` file in your `texmf` directory, you can begin using the package in your documents immediately.

## Sharing a Custom Package

If you want to share your custom package with others, you can create a `.zip` file containing the `.sty` file and any
other necessary files (such as documentation) and distribute it to others.

You can also upload your custom package to a public repository like CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) so that
others can find and use it easily.
