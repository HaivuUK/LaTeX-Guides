## Introduction

This guide is designed to provide a good starting point for those looking to use LaTeX for academic writing. It is not
intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a general purpose guide that will provide a good foundation for those
looking to use LaTeX for academic writing and the transition from other word processing software.

The guide is heavily influenced by the authors experience with LaTeX and the tools that they have found useful. It is
intended to be a living document that will be updated as new tools and techniques are discovered. The guide is not
intended to be a replacement for the official documentation, but rather a focused companion to it.

The sources that helped to create this guide are:

- [The LaTeX Project](#ref1)
- [Overleaf Documentation](#ref2)
- [Comprehensive TeX Archive Network](#ref3)
- [Unofficial PGFPlots guide](#ref4)

and other sources that will be referenced throughout the guide.
