# Compreshensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN)

CTAN is the primary source for TeX packages. This is where all the files in your TeX distribution come and where 
documentation for all the packages can be found. The website is located at [ctan.org](https://ctan.org).

## Searching for Packages

The search bar on the CTAN website is the primary way to find packages. You can search by package name, author, or
description. The search results will show the package name, description, and the last update date.

They are additionally sorted by categories and topics.
